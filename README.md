A little bit about me, my name is Shyla C. Solis. I was born and raised in Stockton, California. I fell in love with Mathematics when I was in the 3rd or 4 th grade. I have always challenged myself to be the best in my class and maintain the highest scores in each of my math classes all the way through highshool. As I neared the end of my first college degree, when I was working towards becoming a high school math teacher, I decided to adopt a BS in mathematics to continue to explore my capabilities and potential in the Mathematics field. I soon took my first programming class and found my second most addictive area. I caught my self losing track of time and biting my nials trying to solve problems while programming. 
As I came to an end of my undergradute degrees, I decided to research what the most powerful area would be for my graduate degree options using math and programming. It turned out, Data Science would be my best option. I am now in the mast year of the Data Science graduate program with the University of the Pacific. Now that I know more about what Dta Science is, I am interested to know more about Machine Learning. 

I'm excited to know what I will ultimately choose to do in the near future.
